## Review 1: Paul  

This project looks pretty interesting! I couldn't come up with too many issues with the draft; I would have liked to have seen a few more code blocks or ipython cells used for munging, but I feel like thats the sort of thing that ends up in for the final presentation. It's possible I missed it, but am curious if this for the best actor category or if that just the example used. No glaring typos or holes in the project. LGTM!  

## Review 2: Lucas
This looks great! I like the subject a lot and like the fact that the tables aren't screenshots and can be interacted with. I like the fact that the data comes in a structure, do you have any plans to use the JSON object for anything besides use in ipython? Could make some neat graphs! The only other thing I found myself wondering would be a breakdown of the what the abbreviations mean for the data set's features. Other than those few things; LGTM!
